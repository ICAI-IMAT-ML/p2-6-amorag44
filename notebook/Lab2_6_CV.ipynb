This validation set is data that the trained model has not seen before, so if the model performs well in this part of the dataset it should generalize well in unseen data. However, as a fortunate partition might happen and generalization error might be underestimated, instead of using a single validation set we use K validation sets and we use the mean error in this K sets as the CV-error. This CV-error should give us a reliable estimation of the generalization error.\n",

If the CV-error is an estimation of the generalization error, the hyperparameter values with least CV-error would result in the least generalization error.
